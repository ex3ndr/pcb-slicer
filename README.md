# PCB Slicer

Slicing software for printing PCB. This is an experimental slicing software required if you want to do 2d prints on 3d printer using low viscosity materials. The key difference from normal filaments is that it would oooze much more and requres too much of pressure advance and usually it is nearly impossible to properly retract. Also when you are doing dispensing in 2d you usually do not care too much about the height of the layer and you can execute neat tricks to avoid oozing and stringing completely.
